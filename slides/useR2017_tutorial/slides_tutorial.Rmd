### Intro to mlr 
<!-- [15 minutes, Bernd] -->

---
### Running and uploading 
<!-- [10 minutes, Bernd] -->

The easiest way to create a run is to

- define a learner using the `mlr` package and to
- apply the learner to a task using the `runTaskMlr` function.

```{r}
# create a randomForest learner
lrn = makeLearner("classif.randomForest", mtry = 2)
# download a task
task = getOMLTask(task.id = 37)
# create the run
run.mlr = runTaskMlr(task, lrn)
```

- You can extract the `BenchmarkResult` object via

```{r}
convertOMLMlrRunToBMR(run.mlr)
```

<!--
- The `run.mlr` object contains three slots
  - `run`: contains the information of the run, i.e., the hyperparameter values and the learner predictions.
  - `bmr`: the `BenchmarkResult` object containing the results of the learner that is applied on the task.
  - `flow`: contains information about the algorithm.
-->
---
### Running and uploading 

- A run created with the `runTaskMlr` function can be uploaded via 
```{r}
run.id = uploadOMLRun(run.mlr)
run.id
```
- The OpenML server assigns a unique `run.id` to the run which 

  - can be used to download the run, i.e., via 
`r sprintf("getOMLRun(%s)", run.id)` or
  - to look up the run online on `r paste0("https://www.openml.org/r/", run.id)`.
  
- The server will automatically compute several evaluation measures for this run.
- It is also possible to upload runs with specific tags using the `tags` argument, so that finding the run with a specific tag becomes easier.

---
class:inverse
### *Practical*  
<!-- [25 minutes, Bernd] -->

- Run your favorite learner/algorithm (from mlr) on task XXX that you already downloaded.
Hint: use `listLearners()` to find appropriate learners for that task.
- Upload your run to OpenML. Add the tag "useR17". 
- Check if the upload worked by going to the website. Also check if the tag was
  added (you can also still add it on the website). 
- Check the predictive performance of the run by looking at several evaluation measures.
  
---
class:inverse
### *Practical*  

- Run your favorite learner/algorithm (from mlr) on task XXX that you already downloaded.
Hint: use `listLearners()` to find appropriate learners for that task.

```{r, echo = -c(3:4)}
# select the learner manually from lrn.list
lrn.list = listLearners()
# or ask for appropriate learners
appropriate.lrn = 
  listLearners(obj = convertOMLTaskToMlr(task)$mlr.task)
# run favorite learner
lrn = makeLearner("classif.rpart")
myrun = runTaskMlr(task, lrn)
```

- Upload your run to OpenML. Add the tag "useR17". 

```{r}
myrun.id = uploadOMLRun(myrun, tags = "useR17")
myrun.id
```

---
class:inverse
### *Practical*  

- Check if the upload worked by going to the website. Also check if the tag was
  added (you can also still add it on the website). 
  
Use the value from `myrun.id` and go to `r paste0("https://www.openml.org/r/", myrun.id)`.

- Check the predictive performance of the run by looking at several evaluation measures.

Go to `r paste0("https://www.openml.org/r/", myrun.id)` and scroll down to *Evaluation measures*. Maybe you have to wait a few seconds/minutes as the server needs to compute the evaluation measures.

You can also get the results via
```{r, eval = FALSE}
listOMLRunEvaluations(run.id = myrun.id)
```


---
## Tags
<!-- [10 minutes, Heidi] -->
Use tags to sort and find data, tasks, flows and runs.

![](slides_tutorial_files/Screenshot_tags.png) 



```{r, eval=FALSE}
uploadOMLRun(myrun, tags = c("tag1", "tag2"))
```

---
## Studies
Studies are an extension of tags and get their own website.   
Tag must be `study_XX`

![](slides_tutorial_files/Screenshot_study.png)

???
- With tasks we can e.g. combine several runs and find them again and make 
a little benchmarking study.
- The information what the tag means probably not obvious to other OpenML users:
this is why we created studies
- Study = tag + website with study information



---
## Studies

![](slides_tutorial_files/Screenshot_study2.png)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
uploadOMLRun(myrun, tags = "study_30")
```


---
## Evaluations
```{r, message=FALSE}
evals = listOMLRunEvaluations(tag = "study_30")
evals[1:3, c("data.name", "learner.name", "predictive.accuracy")]
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
evals$learner.name = as.factor(evals$learner.name)
evals$task.id = as.factor(evals$task.id)

library("ggplot2")
ggplot(evals, aes(x = data.name, y = predictive.accuracy, colour = learner.name,
                  group = learner.name, linetype = learner.name, shape = learner.name)) +
  geom_point() + geom_line() + ylab("Predictive Accuracy") + xlab("Data Set") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -15, hjust = 0))
```

### *Practical*  
<!-- [10 minutes, Heidi] -->

- List the names of all data sets in study_27 
- Summarize the performance results of study_27 (look at predictive accuracy)

> Predictive accuracy is the percentage of instances that are classified correctly.   
> (Information like this can be found on [openml.org/a](https://www.openml.org/a))

- Bonus questions for fast solvers: 
  + What are the two different versions of ksvm?
  + What do the different setup.id s mean?

class:inverse

### *Practical*  
<!-- [10 minutes, Heidi] -->

- List the names of all data sets in study_27
- Summarize the performance results of study_27

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.height=2}
{{evals = listOMLRunEvaluations(tag = "study_27")}}
evals$setup.id = as.factor(evals$setup.id)

library("ggplot2")
ggplot(evals, aes(x = setup.id, y = predictive.accuracy, 
                  color = data.name, group = data.name)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  facet_grid(~ flow.name, scales = "free")
```

---
class:inverse
Why are there two different versions of the flow?
```{r}
fids <- unique(evals$flow.id)
flws <- lapply(fids, getOMLFlow)
flws
```

---
class:inverse
What are the different setup IDs?
```{r}
rids <- evals$run.id
runs <- lapply(rids, getOMLRun)
params <- lapply(runs, getOMLRunParList)
params[[1]]
params[[5]]
params[[19]]
```
The difference seems to be the type.

---
class:inverse
Let's add the type info to the evals data frame.
```{r}
evals$type <- sapply(params, 
                     function(x) ifelse(is.null(x$type$value), 
                                        NA, x$type$value))
evals$type


evals$type[is.na(evals$type)] <- getDefaults( 
  getParamSet( 
{{  convertOMLFlowToMlr(flws[[1]])}}
  ) 
)$type

evals$type
```

---
class:inverse
Now we can make a more understandable plot.
```{r, fig.height=3}
ggplot(evals, aes(x = type, y = predictive.accuracy, 
                  color = data.name, group = data.name)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + 
  facet_grid(~ flow.name, scales = "free")
```

### OpenML Bot 
- Currently completing 100.000+ runs per day on Azure
- Exploring hyperparameters of xgboost,  ranger, and other popular machine learning algorithms
- Using 75 datasets from study_14

![](slides_tutorial_files/robot_profil.PNG)

---
### OpenML meta learning: Making defaults great again!
- Choose between different performance measures (AUC, RMSE, ...)
- Predict the pareto front for this measure and the training time
- E. g. for xgboost: Prediction for hyperparameters on a new dataset, which will outperform the defaults

![](slides_tutorial_files/xgboost_pareto_front.png)

### OpenML in drug discovery
Predict which drugs will inhibit certain proteins   
(and hence viruses, parasites, ...)
